# Introducing Lucretius
## Game Overview
Welcome to the Lucretius complex - a grand complex where you can make friends and work together to organize auctions, exhibitions, contests, and other community events. By interacting with other players and participating in community events, you can earn rewards. Players can then use these rewards in exchange for in-game assets.
The Lucretius complex is an excellent attempt to create a genuinely public application with an exciting plot that would attract a large portion of the gaming community, blockchain enthusiasts, and DeFi nerds. The map of the Lucretius complex was inspired by the XRP logo. The first version of the game will launch on almost 300,000 square feet of space. The complex will spread across two floors and contain 27 shops (27 on the first floor and 3 on the second floor.
The game features a fluid, intuitive and attractive interface with many features to explore. As a player, you are in complete control, and you determine how much you want to interact with the game’s decentralized features and DeFi. Furthermore, we built the Lucretius project with a narrative that cannot expire; it is continuous and will live forever.

## Business objectives, market, and target audience
Lucretius is not to be seen as a game for only blockchain players. It does not require any prior knowledge about cryptocurrencies or blockchain technology in general. The main target is the adventurous segment of the gaming community. Our target audience is slightly bigger than the blockchain gaming community and, by extension, has more potential for revenue.

## Goals
The Lucretius complex is a unique game with an inspiring background story, an exciting plot, fun features and other characteristics. On the basis of these qualities and considering the segment of the gaming industry the game is targeting, we are confident that the Lucretius complex can compete on the global scene and reach one million players within a short period.  
The primary reason is because enjoying the game does not require any prior interest, knowledge or experience with these types of games. The plan is to fully develop the potentials of the XRPL blockchain technology while shielding players from all the complexity that comes with it.
